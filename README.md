This is my To-Do List Project. It is a simple and interactive web application built by me using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete. This project demonstrates proficiency in DOM manipulation. This Project idea is for showcasing my skills in front-end development and user interface design.
